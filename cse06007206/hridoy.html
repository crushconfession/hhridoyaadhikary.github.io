<h1>HRIDOY, A SOMNAMBULIST BOY</h1>
<div id="int">
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>•	Fortunately, my thirst for knowledge did not come to an end when I was at school. I was passionate about<br/> 
istory and science. This passion  helped me gain profound knowledge in these areas, and I was admitted to the<br>
 college of my dreams. Today, I am a student of Computer science and engineering, and I feel very happy about it.</p>
<h2>My goals</h2>
<p>•	I am certain that my degree will become my ticket to a better tomorrow.I want to become an engineer in the<br/>
 field of employment legislation. I study hard  and devote my free time to reading books and watching video tutorial about my study.</p>
<h2>My ups and downs</h2>
<p>•	Of course, I understand that life is not just a bed of roses, and challenges and hardships are an integra<br/> 
element of life. Since my parents could not help me cover my college expenses in full, paying off my student loan<br/>
 has become an important challenge for me. I combine a part-time job and full-time study to earn my living and my<br/>
 education. I feel triumphant at the beginning of every month when I receive my salary and plan how I will spend my money.</p>

<h2>About Myself</h2>
<p>I know that I am special and there's no one else out there that's like me... so enjoy! (Smile)<br/>
I was born in Bangladesh on May 5, 1998. I had a very simple and happy childhood, and my only sibling, my younger brother.<br/>
I am introverted and am perfectly happy watching quality movies or using a personal computer during my spare time.
 I lived in Barguna.<br/> For four year before I came to Dhaka, Siddheswari.<br/>
Becoming a Social Worker/full-time ministry has become my plan, especially when I like working with special needs Kids. 
I planned in<br/> working in the field of Education as a Social Worker and Preach the Word of God.<br/>
Finally, it wouldn't hurt to travel to amazing places, continue to meet wonderful people.<br/>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p>•	I have come to believe that two main factors determine success. First of all is a person’s <br/>
own determination and will to succeed. Are you ready to make sacrifices to achieve your goal, like<br/>
 working and studying at the same time? Are you prepared to recover after failure and proceed to<br/>
 your goal again? Without strong internal motivation, it is nearly impossible to become successful.</p>
<p>•	Equally important is the support of people around you. Being determined to succeed does not<br/>
 mean alienating everyone and stepping on other people in order to achieve your goal. On the contrary,<br/>
 success is about recognizing your weaknesses and accepting support from people who genuinely want to<br/>
 help you. For instance, if it were not for my parents’ support of my educational endeavors, I would <br/>
 perhaps not be attending class today.</p>
<p>Would you call this student an inspirational leader like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.">Martin Luther King</a>, Jr.?<br/>
In all honesty, no. He may be an interesting and nice person, but he hasn’t left such a mark on history<br/> as some other people have—at least not yet.
But can you learn something from his story? Most definitely.</p>
