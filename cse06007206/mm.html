<p><strong>Diana, princess of Wales</strong>, original name <strong>Diana Frances Spencer</strong>, <br/>
(born July 1, 1961, Sandringham, Norfolk, England—died August 31, 1997, Paris, France),<br/> former consort (1981–96) 
of<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-prince-of-Wales">Charles, prince of Wales</a>; mother of the heir second in line to<br/>
 the British throne,<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Prince-William-duke-of-Cambridge"> Prince William,

 <div id="edu">
<h3>Early Life And Education</h3>
<p>Diana was born at Park House, the home that her parents rented on<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elizabeth-II"> Queen Elizabeth </a>
II’s estate at <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sandringham"> Sandringham</a> and<br/> where Diana’s <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/childhood">
 childhood</a> playmates were the queen’s younger sons,<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrew-duke-of-York">
 Prince Andrew</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Prince-Edward-earl-of-Wessex-and-Viscount-Severn"> Prince Edward.</a>
 She was the<br/> third child and youngest daughter of Edward John Spencer, Viscount Althorp, heir to the 7th Earl Spencer, and his<br/> first wife, Frances
 Ruth Burke Roche (daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy). Her parents’ troubled marriage ended in<br/> divorce when Diana was a child, and she, along with 
 her brother and two sisters, remained with her father. She became<br/> Lady Diana Spencer when her father succeeded to the earldom in 1975. Riddlesworth
 Hall (near<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Thetford-England"> Thetford</a>,<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Norfolk-county-England">
 Norfolk</a>)<br/> and West Heath School
 (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sevenoaks-district-England">Sevenoaks</a>,<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Kent-county-England"> Kent</a>)
 provided the young Diana’s schooling.
 After attending the finishing school<br/> of Chateau d’Oex at <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Montreux"> Montreux</a>,<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Switzerland"> Switzerland</a>,
 Diana returned to<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/England"> England</a> and became a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/kindergarten"> kindergarten</a> assistant at the<br/> fashionable
 Young England school in Pimlico.</p>

<h3>Marriage And Divorce</h3>
<p>She renewed her contacts with the royal family, and her friendship with <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-prince-of-Wales"> 
Charles</a> grew in 1980.
 On February 24, 1981,<br/> their engagement was announced, and her beauty and shy demeanour—which earned
 her the nickname “Shy Di”—made her<br/> an instant sensation with the media and the public. The couple married 
 in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Saint-Pauls-Cathedral-London"> St. Paul’s Cathedral</a> on July 29, 1981, in a<br/> 
 globally televised ceremony watched by an audience numbering 
 in the hundreds of millions. Their first child,<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Prince-William-duke-of-Cambridge"> 
 Prince<br/> William Arthur Philip Louis of Wales</a>, was born 
 on June 21, 1982, and their second,<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Prince-Harry-of-Wales"> 
 Prince Henry (“Harry”)<br/> Charles Albert David</a>, on September 15, 1984.</p>

<p>“Princess Di” rapidly evolved into an icon of grace, elegance, and glamour. Exuding natural charm and<br/> charisma,
 she used her celebrity status to aid numerous charitable causes, and her changing hairstyles and wardrobe<br/> made her
 a fashion trendsetter. Behind the scenes, however, marital difficulties between the princess and prince were<br/> growing.
 Diana struggled with severe <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/postpartum-depression"> postnatal depression</a>, 
 low self-esteem, eating disorders, and the mounting strain<br/> of being
 constantly pursued by both the official media royal-watchers and the tabloid press, particularly the paparazzi.<br/> The
 marital breakdown became increasingly apparent amid mutual recriminations, tell-all biographies, and admissions<br/> of 
 infidelity on both sides, and the couple formally separated in 1992. Diana presented her side in Andrew Morton’s <br/>
 controversial book Diana: Her True Story (1992) and in an unusually candid television interview in 1995. After<br/>
 prolonged negotiations that left Diana with a substantial financial settlement but without the title Her Royal<br/>
 Highness, the couple’s divorce became final on August 28, 1996.</p>

<h3>“The People’s Princess” And Charity Work</h3>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/divorce"> divorce</a>, Diana maintained her high public
 profile and continued many of the activities she had <br/>
earlier undertaken on behalf of charities, supporting causes as diverse as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-arts">
 the arts</a>, children’s issues, and<br/> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/AIDS">
 AIDS</a> patients. She also was involved in efforts to ban <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/land-mine">land mines</a>.
 To ensure that William and Harry had “an<br/> understanding of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/People-magazine"> people’s</a>
 emotions, their insecurities, people’s distress, and their hopes and dreams,” Diana<br/> 
 brought her sons with her to hospitals, homeless shelters, and orphanages. To acquaint them with the world<br/>
 outside royal privilege, she took them to fast food restaurants and on <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/mass-transit"> public transportation</a>
 . Her compassion,<br/>personal warmth, humility, and accessibility earned her the sobriquet “the People’s Princess.”</p>

 <div id="death">
<h3>Death And Funeral</h3>
<p>Long one of the most-photographed women in the world, Diana’s unprecedented popularity both in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/United-Kingdom">
 Britain</a> and <br/>
abroad continued after her divorce. Although she used that celebrity to great effect in promoting her charitable<br/>
 work, the media (in particular the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/paparazzo">paparazzi</a>) were often intrusive.
 It was while attempting to evade pursuing<br/>
 journalists that Diana was killed, along with her companion,<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Emad-Fayed"> Dodi Fayed</a>,
 and their driver, Henri Paul, in an<br/>
 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/automobile">automobile</a> accident in a tunnel under the streets of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Paris"> Paris</a>
 in 1997.</p>
 <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/29/world/01Diana5/xxDianaLastYear5-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale" hight="400"width="400">

 <p>Though the photographers were initially blamed for causing the accident, a French judge in 1999 cleared them <br/>
 of any wrongdoing, instead faulting Paul, who was found to have had a blood alcohol level over the legal limit<br>
 at the time of the crash and to have taken prescription drugs incompatible with alcohol. In 2006 a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scotland-Yard">
 Scotland Yard</a><br/>
 inquiry into the incident also concluded that the driver was at fault. In April 2008, however, a British inquest<br/>
 jury ruled both the driver and the paparazzi guilty of unlawful killing through grossly negligent driving, though<br/>
 it found no evidence of a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/conspiracy">conspiracy</a> to kill Diana or Fayed,
 an accusation long made by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mohamed-al-Fayed"> Fayed’s father</a>.</p>



<p>Her death produced unprecedented expressions of public mourning, testifying to her enormous hold on the British <br/>
national psyche. The royal family, apparently caught off guard by the extraordinary outpouring of grief and by<br/>
 criticism of their emotional reticence, broke with tradition in arranging the internationally televised royal funeral.<br/>
 The image of Prince William, then age 15, and Prince Harry, then age 12, walking solemnly with their father behind<br/>
 Diana’s casket in her funeral cortege became iconic. At Diana’s funeral <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elton-John">
 Sir Elton John</a> performed a version of his<br/>classic song “<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Candle-in-the-Wind">Candle in the Wind</a>”
 (originally written about actress <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marilyn-Monroe"> Marilyn Monroe</a>) with lyrics that had been revised <br/>
 by his songwriting partner, Bernie Taupin, to reflect on the life and death of Diana, including</p>

 <img src="https://societyofrock.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Elton-John-Princess-Diana-funeral-1-735x413.jpg"hight="400" width="400">
<p>Goodbye England’s rose;<br/>
May you ever grow in our hearts.<br/>
You were the grace that placed yourself<br/>
Where lives were torn apart.</p>
<p>The recording of that version of the song became the most successful pop single in history to date, selling more than <br/>
30 million copies.Diana’s life, and her death, polarized national feeling about the existing system of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/monarchy">
monarchy </a>(and,<br/>
 in a sense, about British identity), which appeared antiquated and unfeeling in a populist age of media celebrity in
 which Diana herself was a central figure.</p>
